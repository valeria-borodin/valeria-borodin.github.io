I am an Associate Professor at IMT Atlantique, France, since 2023. Prior to that, I served as Associate Professor at Mines Saint Etienne (Centre of Microelectronics in Provence), being actively involved in academic-industrial collaborations and knowledge and innovation transfer activities in the industry. I hold a Ph.D. degree in Optimization and Systems Safety from the University of Technology of Troyes, France. My research interests refer to the management of quantitative operations within manufacturing and logistics systems, including modeling, optimization, operations research, and data analytics.
